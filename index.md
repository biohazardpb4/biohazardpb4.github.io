Welcome to my portfolio of public projects! Since most of my development time goes into my day job, these generally have a lower level of polish than something I'd make for that.

Apps:
- [Cast Bowling](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jprodevelopment.castbowling){:target="_blank"} is a multiplayer bowling game for the Chromecast.
- [Fist Pump Revolution](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=FPR.FistPumpRevolutionDemo){:target="_blank"} is a game in which you're judged by how well you can fist pump to certain songs.
- [Gains](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gains.activity){:target="_blank"} is a workout tracker useful for quickly recording and viewing amounts of weights lifted over time.

Sites:
- [Peer Advisr](http://www.peeradvisr.com/){:target="_blank"} lets users anonymously ask questions to someone in a target audience, and strike up a conversation after an answer while remaining anonymous.

Profiles:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prombo/){:target="_blank"}
- [Google Play Listings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=JPro%20Development&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
